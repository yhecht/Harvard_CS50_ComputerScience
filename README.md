### What I Learned:
- thought methodically & computationally
- programmed procedurally
- represented & processed information
- communicated succinctly and precisely
- solved problems efficiently
- recognized patterns among problems
- decomposed problems into parts & composed solutions thereto
- operated at multiple levels of abstraction
- separated design from implementation details
- infered from first principles how systems work
- assessed correctness, design & style of code
- taught myselve new languages
- identifed threats to privacy and security
- read documentation, drawed conclusions from specifications
- tested solutions to problems, found faults & identified corner cases
- described symptoms of problems precisely and ask questions clearly
- identified & quantified tradeoffs among resources, particularly time and space

The course, including its problem set questions, and data sets were provided by [David J. Malan](https://cs.harvard.edu/malan/), Gordon McKay Professor of the Practice of Computer Science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and a Member of the Faculty of Education in the Graduate School of Education at Harvard University. He teaches Computer Science 50, otherwise known as CS50, which is Harvard University's largest course. He also teaches at Harvard Business School, Harvard Law School, Harvard Extension School, and Harvard Summer School. All of his courses are freely available as OpenCourseWare.
